We present the first deep learning model to successfully learn control policies directly
from high-dimensional sensory input using reinforcement learning. The
model is a convolutional neural network, trained with a variant of Q-learning,
whose input is raw pixels and whose output is a value function estimating future
rewards. We apply our method to seven Atari 2600 games from the Arcade Learning
Environment, with no adjustment of the architecture or learning algorithm. We
find that it outperforms all previous approaches on six of the games and surpasses
a human expert on three of them.
