Representation learning and option discovery are
two of the biggest challenges in reinforcement
learning (RL). Proto-value functions (PVFs) are
a well-known approach for representation learning
in MDPs. In this paper we address the option
discovery problem by showing how PVFs
implicitly define options. We do it by introducing
eigenpurposes, intrinsic reward functions derived
from the learned representations. The options
discovered from eigenpurposes traverse the
principal directions of the state space. They are
useful for multiple tasks because they are discovered
without taking the environment’s rewards
into consideration. Moreover, different options
act at different time scales, making them helpful
for exploration. We demonstrate features of
eigenpurposes in traditional tabular domains as
well as in Atari 2600 games.
